<h2>P. Independent</h2>

<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td align="justify">
The princess of PonyLand would like to play with her friends
(she has lots of friends), but she is a peace loving
creature so she does not want to invite ponies who hate
each other (those usually end up quarrelling).
<p>
Fortunately recent advances in online social networking
in PonyLand produced a hugely successful anti-social
website that collects data about which ponies hate
each other.
Of course the princess cannot simply access to this data
due to proper privacy regulations in PonyLand, but she is
in negotiations with the anti-social website owners.
<p>
While the negotiation is going on, an anonymized
version of the anti-social graph of her friends is available.
<p>
Preparing for the party, the princess would like
at least to know how many ponies she can invite
at most.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input is the anonymized anti-social graph.
First line contains N and M the number of vertices
and edges, the following M lines contain two
numbers between 0 and N-1, an edge of the graph.
<p>
It turns out that the anti-social graph in
PonyLand has no cycles in it.

<h3>Output</h3>
The output is the number of ponies the princess can
invite at most such that none of them are connected
in the anti-social graph.

<h3>Example input</h3>
